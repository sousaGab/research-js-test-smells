Backup and File Replacement Manager for LLM Refactoring Pipeline.

This module provides safe file handling operations for the refactoring process:
- Creating backups before modifications
- Replacing specific code snippets in files
- Restoring files from backups (undo functionality)

All operations preserve directory structure and provide comprehensive logging.
